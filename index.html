                <h3>Choosing the Best Disinfectant Product</h3>
                <p>Whether sanitizing after an illness or keeping certain bacteria at bay, it’s important to take note of active ingredients, EPA Registration Numbers, and desired applications in order to select the best disinfectant cleaners for your home.</p>
                <h3>Active Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Hydrogen peroxide: This time-tested ingredient is often found in disinfectant products that are intended for use on hard, non-porous surfaces, and it can be found in sprays and liquids. Hydrogen peroxide can also be used right out of the bottle by applying it to hard, non-porous surfaces and allowing it to remain on for one minute before wiping dry.</p>
                <p>Chlorine and chlorine products: In the form of sodium chloride, good old household bleach has been a standby for decades in cleaning and disinfecting. This solution can be used in a sprayer or can be sponged on a hard, non-porous surface, and should be allowed to remain on the surface for five minutes before wiping off. Chlorine in other forms, such as benzalkonium chloride, is also found in disinfectant products combined with other ingredients. However, do not mix household bleach with any other type of cleaner because there’s a possibility it could result in toxic fumes.
                </p>
                <p>Formaldehyde: A water-based form of formaldehyde, called “formalin,” is commonly used to sterilize and disinfect industrial settings, including hospitals as it kills both viruses and bacteria. While formaldehyde effectively destroys pathogens, its fumes are considered toxic and it should only be used as directed on the label.</p>
                <p> Glutaraldehydes: Similar to formaldehyde, glutaraldehydes kill viruses and bacteria on hard non-porous surfaces. Products containing these ingredients can be purchased as concentrated liquids, intended for use in sprayers.</p>
                <p> Phenols: Another industrial product, phenolic disinfectants will kill bacteria and viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces. This active ingredient can be found in liquid form for diluting with water and applying directly to floors (mopping), countertops, and other hard surfaces.</p>
                <p> Different products may bear the same number, and this just means that they have the same active ingredients. For example, hydrogen peroxide is the active ingredient in Ecolab’s Peroxide Disinfectant and Glass Cleaner RTU, and it has been given the EPA registration number 1677-251. If you find a product with the same registration number, although the name may be different, it will contain the same active ingredients as the Ecolab product. To find out all products registered under a specific number, you can search the EPA Registration database by number, product name, company name, or chemical name.</p>
                <h3>Application Type</h3>
                <p>Aerosol can: This type of product delivers a fine mist of spray that covers a large area to disinfect hard surfaces, such as showers and countertops or—depending on the ingredients—clothing, draperies, and upholstery.</p>

<p>Spray bottle: Many disinfectants come in spray bottles, where the product is dispensed through a trigger action. There is also the option to purchase empty spray bottles and fill them with diluted cleaners or homemade disinfectants (such as the bleach solution mentioned above). Cleaners in spray bottles are generally intended for use on hard non-porous surfaces.</p>

<p>Wipes: Intended for quick cleaning, wipes come pre-moistened in a container and can be removed one at a time for wiping down faucets, door handles, and other frequently touched objects.</p>

<p>Liquid: Liquid applications may be used directly out of the bottle or jug, or may come in a concentrated form that requires dilution with water before use. While most liquids can be used to fill spray bottles, some are intended to be sponged on a surface. To understand when and how to apply the liquid, be sure to read and follow directions carefully.</p>
                <h3>Our Top Picks</h3>
                <p>Editor’s note: Prepping pantries and cleaning caddies for COVID-19 has caused aerosol disinfectant purchases in the first week of March 2020 to increase 385.3 percent from the year prior, NPR reports, and other household cleaners are seeing similar spikes. As a result, online retailers are finding it difficult to keep these products stocked. Note that some with brick and mortar stores that are still open have products available in stores only. To aid your search, we’ve included links to a couple of retailers per recommendation so that you can check multiple sellers to see which has restocked soonest and locate local options if possible.</p>

For disinfecting hard surfaces, such as cabinets, and soft surfaces, such as upholstery, consider Lysol Disinfectant Spray.

For cleaning and disinfecting tubs, shower, sinks, and toilets, check out Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach. It removes stains, disinfects, and leaves a sparkling clean finish. Because it contains bleach, the spray should only be used on color-safe, non-porous surfaces, such as tile, porcelain, and acrylic.

Amazon buyers love cleaning and disinfecting in one step, calling it the “best cleaning product for items that can be cleaned with bleach” and saying it “does a wonderful job of removing stains.” Its EPA Registration Number is 5813-21, and it’s available from Amazon and Walmart.</p>

While no rinsing is required on floors or other surfaces, the product should be left on for two minutes before wiping with clean paper towels. Amazon buyers like the idea of mixing their own disinfectant and claim Mediclean not only disinfects but also “smells great” and is great for “general cleaning” around the house.
